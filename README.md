	The image button next to restart button toggles the flag state. By default, the reveal option is selected and it shows flag image.
	The first click is free, i.e. the mines should be set on the first click to ensure that the user’s first click doesn’t detonate a mine.
	The timer starts when user plays his first move and stops when user wins or looses the game. The time turns into pause state if activity is paused and resumes when activity resumes.
	If a button is revealed, then it is disabled and no more clicks are allowed on it. User cannot reveal a button marked as flag. When a button is flagged, it shows flag image.
	At the end of the game, the game time is stored and board buttons are disabled. High score ie best game time is only updated if the user wins the game. The high scores are displayed on the main activity along with their last game time.
	If the user wins the round, he can share his playing time with his friends in the form of message with the help of messaging apps (like Gmail, Whatsapp, etc) installed on his device.
